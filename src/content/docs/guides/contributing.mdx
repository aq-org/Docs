## Code
If you wish to submit code to AQ, you can start by reading the style guide in the developer documentation. Then, write the relevant code based on other documents in the developer documentation.<br/>

1. Fork [AQ's GitHub repository](https://github.com/aq-org/AQ). (If this is your first time submitting code to AQ)
2. Write the relevant code in your forked repository.
3. Submit a Pull Request, including a description of the code you've written.
4. Wait for the code to be merged. (We may contact you if we have any questions about the code you submitted)

:::note
If you are a core developer (with permission to submit directly to the core repository):
1. Do not submit code directly to the core repository.
2. Write code carefully, especially if you choose to merge a Pull Request directly.
3. When submitting a Pull Request, please include a brief description to help others understand.

## Pull Request
### Submitting a Pull Request
When submitting a Pull Request, please add a brief title or description explaining the content of the submission.<br/>

### Reviewing a Pull Request
If you are a core developer (with permission to submit directly to the core repository), you can review Pull Requests in the AQ repository. If the Pull Request meets the requirements, you can merge it directly. When merging a Pull Request, please write a descriptive commit message. Do not use GitHub's default message.<br/>

:::note
If you are unsure about the submission, do not merge the Pull Request directly. Please wait for another core developer to review it, whether the Pull Request is from yourself or someone else.

## Documentation
### Writing Documentation
If you wish to write documentation for AQ, you can follow these steps:<br/>

1. Fork [AQ Docs' GitHub repository](https://github.com/aq-org/docs). (If this is your first time submitting documentation to AQ Docs)
2. Write the relevant documentation in your forked repository.
3. Submit a Pull Request, including a description of the documentation you've written.

### Translating Documentation
To translate documentation, follow the same steps as writing documentation. When translating, try to maintain the original style and format. You can use relevant tools, but please ensure language accuracy.<br/>

If you have additional language needs, you can raise an Issue. If you are capable of translating into more languages, you can directly add the language. (To add a language, you need to first add the sidebar translation in the astro.config.mjs file)<br/>
