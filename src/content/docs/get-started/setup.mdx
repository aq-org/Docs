description: Quickly install `AQ` software and set up the development environment.
---

`AQ` is currently in the early stages of development, and no official version of the software has been released yet. You can first `check the developer documentation` or `contact us` to learn about the progress. You are also welcome to participate in the development of `AQ`; we greatly appreciate any help with `AQ`. If you have any questions, feel free to `submit Issues on GitHub` or `contact us`.

Although `AQ` has not been officially released, you can still compile and run a development version of the software from the project's `source code` for testing and experience. However, please note that the software is still under development, and its quality and stability may not be guaranteed.
