## Introduction
The AQ virtual machine is a high-performance virtual environment designed for running and debugging AQ bytecode. It provides an abstract execution layer that allows AQ bytecode to run seamlessly across multiple platforms. The virtual machine supports memory management, garbage collection, multithreading, and other features while optimizing instruction execution speed and resource efficiency. With this virtual machine, developers can run consistent AQ bytecode on different hardware and operating systems, offering robust support for cross-platform development.<br/>

## Development Progress
As the core component of AQ, the AQ virtual machine became the highest priority in development after several revisions of the AQ development plan.<br/>

However, due to slow development and changes in plans, it has undergone several redesigns.<br/>

Currently, the decision has been made to abandon the original code and start prototyping from scratch, continuously improving the prototype until development is complete.<br/>

You can view the code on GitHub or join the development effort.<br/>
