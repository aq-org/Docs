title: Overview
description: AQ is an interpreted programming language. It is fast, small, simple and safe. At the same time, programs written in AQ can also be compiled. Maybe a great piece of work.

### Introduction
`AQ` is an interpreted programming language similar to `Python` and `Java`. However, compared to the latter two, it offers a *simpler syntax* and *more powerful features*. Additionally, `AQ` provides *robust performance* through techniques like `multithreading`.<br/>
`AQ` is written in `C` and has undergone multiple revisions. The early version of the project was created in `October 2023`, with the official project starting in `February 2024`. Initially, the development of `AQ` focused on the `compiler` layer. However, since the final programs require the support of a `virtual machine` to run, the development later shifted to focus on the `virtual machine` first.<br/>
The `AQ virtual machine` is currently under development. Given the scope of the work, the prototype of the `AQ virtual machine` is being designed first, with plans to address missing code and documentation in subsequent updates.<br/>

### Features
- **Fast** (`source code` compilation and `execution speed`)
- **Small** (`source code` size)
- **Simple** (easy to learn)
- **Safe** (secure `memory management` and `code checking`)
- **Cross-platform** (supports `Windows`, `Linux`, `MacOS`, etc.)
- Similar to `C++` syntax (quick to grasp)
- Interpreted (optional `compilation`)
- Free (under the `AQ License`)
- Open-source (based on the `AQ License`)

### Installation
`AQ` is still in its early development stages, and no official software release is available yet. You can `view the developer documentation` or `contact us` to check the progress. You are also welcome to participate in the development of `AQ`; we greatly appreciate any help with the project. If you have any questions, feel free to submit `issues` on `GitHub` or `contact us`.
